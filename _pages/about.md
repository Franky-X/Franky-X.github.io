Hello everyone! Welcome to my site! My name is Chaoran Xiong.<br>
I will receive the B.Eng. degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Soochow University, Soochow, China in 2023. In the very near future(2023 - 2028), I am going to work toward the Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Engineering with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.<br>
My research interests include sensor fusion, multi-sensor sychronization, and optical wireless communication and positioning.
