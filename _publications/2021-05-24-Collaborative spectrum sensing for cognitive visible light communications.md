excerpt: 'Cognitive visible light communication (VLC) has attracted increasing attention. By sharing underutilized VLC spectrum resources of primary users (PUs) with secondary users (SUs) opportunistically, improved spectrum utilization can be achieved without interfering with PUs. As an essential component in cognitive VLC, reliable spectrum sensing is crucial to ensure accurate cognition of PU’s signal. However, due to limiting factors such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and link blocking in VLC systems, it would be difficult for a single SU to identify the status of PUs accurately and rapidly. To tackle this issue, we propose a new collaborative sensing (CS) scheme which can enhance sensing accuracy effectively by coordinating multiple SUs to participate in spectrum sensing.'
