The invention provides a visible light communication system with adaptive dimming and a modulation and demodulation method. The system includes: a source; an adaptive M-PAM modulator, separately modulating a signal transmitted by the signal source into a first and a second electrical signal; and a dual-path pulse generator, alternately generating a first and a second pulse control signal, where the first and the second pulse control signal are both periodic signals, where when a remaining operating duration of a high level of the first pulse control signal equals to a time of a rising edge of the second pulse control signal, the second pulse control signal starts to be generated, and when a remaining operating duration of a high level of the second pulse control signal is equal to a time of a rising edge of the first pulse control signal, the first pulse control signal starts to be generated.
